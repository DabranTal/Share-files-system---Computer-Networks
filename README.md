### About
For this project, we were asked to write a "share files system" that lets users link directories that share the same content.

Our system supports deleting, editing, and creating files and directories.

Every action on one of the directories that share brings an update on the other directories that share.

#### Thechnologies

Our system has been written in Python and uses the "watchdog" API library for monitoring and the "socket" API library to communicate between directories.

We used our knowledge of computer networks to create ongoing communication using TCP sockets.
